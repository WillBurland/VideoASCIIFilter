# Video To ASCII Filter

## About the project

This program prompts the user for a video file, then after a short time, creates a new video file, which is the inputted file, with a coloured ASCII filter applied. This was my first major venture into multithreading with file IO, where many CPU threads were created to work on frames of the video independently of each other.
